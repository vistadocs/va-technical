PURPOSE: The Standards and Conventions (SAC) Work Group was established to define and review national standards for software developed within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This applies to System Design and Development (SD&D) efforts to modernize VHA systems, as well as to other OI development for VistA and to field development. The SAC Work Group will be responsible for promoting consistency in development standards by authoring the Programming Standards and Conventions (SAC) and the Graphical Userâ€™s Interface Standards and Conventions (GUI SAC). The SAC Work Group is also to serve as an arbiter when issues of conformance to SAC arise.

MISSION: The mission of the SAC Work Group is to:

1. Provide a cornerstone for all national software developed and distributed within VHA;
2. Provide mandates for functional soundness and technical correctness of VistA and all other programs written in the M programming language as well as programs written for the desktop environment;
3. Provide a base of utilities and techniques for uniformity;
4. To rule on disputes about the interpretations of the SAC; and
5. To rule on requests for exemptions to a particular section of the SAC.
